## Procedure

Please follow these steps to do the real experiment.

#### Equipment and Materials:
- Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR)
- Stirring mechanism or impeller
- Temperature control system (heating or cooling)
- pH control system (pH meter and controller)
- Feed solution(s)
- Reactant(s)
- Inlet and outlet valves
- Sampling tools (sterile pipettes or syringes)
- Analytical instruments for measuring parameters (e.g., pH meter, spectrophotometer)

#### Setup:

-Set up the CSTR according to the specific requirements of your experiment.<br>
-Ensure the CSTR is clean and free from any contaminants.<br>
-Install the stirring mechanism or impeller in the CSTR.<br>
-Connect the temperature control system to the CSTR for maintaining the desired temperature.<br>
-Set up the pH control system if pH control is required.<br>
### Preparation:
-Prepare the reaction mixture according to the specific requirements of your experiment. This may involve dissolving reactants in a suitable solvent or preparing a feed solution.<br>
-Sterilize the CSTR, impeller, and any other equipment that will come in contact with the reaction mixture if necessary.<br>

### CSTR Experiment:
-Transfer the reaction mixture to the CSTR.
-Start the stirring mechanism at a predetermined speed to provide adequate mixing and ensure uniform conditions within the reactor.<br>
-Set the desired temperature for the reaction and allow the system to equilibrate.<br>
-Adjust the pH to the desired level using the pH control system, if applicable.<br>
-Initiate the flow of reactants into the CSTR at a predetermined rate. This can be done using a pump or gravity feed system.<br>
-Monitor and record the reaction parameters such as temperature, pH, and flow rates of reactants at regular intervals.<br>
-Take samples from the CSTR at specified time points for analysis. The frequency of sampling depends on the specific experiment and reaction kinetics.<br>
-Analyze the samples for various parameters of interest, such as conversion, product concentration, reaction rate, or any other relevant variables.<br>
-If necessary, make adjustments to the reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, pH, reactant concentrations) based on the measured parameters.<br>
### Post-Experiment:
-Analyze and interpret the collected data, comparing it with the expected outcomes or previous research.<br>
-Calculate relevant reaction parameters, such as conversion, yield, selectivity, or reaction rate, depending on your experiment goals.<br>
-Draw conclusions based on the results and discuss any insights or observations.<br>
### Clean-up:
-After the experiment is complete, drain the contents of the CSTR and properly dispose of any waste materials following the appropriate guidelines.<br>
-Clean the CSTR, impeller, and other equipment thoroughly using appropriate cleaning agents and sterilize if necessary.<br>
-Properly dispose of any waste materials, such as contaminated samples or reaction mixtures, in accordance with your institution's guidelines.<br>
